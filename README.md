# AgeApp
Python app to calculate a person's age to 1 decimal place.

Takes two dates and finds the number of years between them to 1 decimal place.

Also reversed the process: given an age 1 decimal place, find the possible date range of the date of birth.

# What I learned:
* Use math.floor for floor division since we don't want to round up the person's age.
* Use timedelta to find the possible date ranges given an age.
